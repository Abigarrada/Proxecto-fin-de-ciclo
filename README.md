# Fantasy F1

Fantasy F1 is a school project created as part of the Campus Dual TIC Full Stack Bootcamp in 2023. 

## How it works

Fantasy F1 is a Fantasy League created with the data of Formula 1 as an sport. In this app, you can:

- Create a new user.
- Create a new league, which could be public or private.
- Join an existing league (both public and private).
- Buy a maximum of two drivers as part of your team per league, within the limitations of your budget.
- Change drivers after each race.
  - Bear in mind that the price of a driver will be affected by theis performance on each race. This will also affect your budget if you choose to sell a driver.
- Compare the performance of the different drivers.
- Compete with other people to win.
